Nageswararao Asi	IDENTIFYING THE SYSTEM / SERVER NAME OF THE EXTERNAL PURGE SERVICE, WHERE IT IS RUNNING!!!!!!	2018-06-13T00:00:00.000Z	rfe	Product Related	5	IMPLEMENTATION	Once user enabled/run the External purge, by observing services like PURGE_SERVICE,Hpp.Purge Service, once these two services will be get locked and we can observe same into the b2bi dashboard.This is the only option/assurance by which we can confirm that External Purge is running  In case of clustering B2Bi setup, we can't find on which system/node of B2Bi external purge service is physically running. To find the same, user has to connect to the physcial server and search for external purge processid under b2bi Installation directory. We do have only one option till date by executing the select query (i.e select * from locks).  It would be good option if we can provide system/server/node details on our dashboard under Operations->LockManager by which user can easily identify under which system/server External Purge Service is running.
Nageswararao Asi	AUTO Unlock functionality of EXTERNAL PURGE SERVICE!!!	2018-06-13T00:00:00.000Z	rfe	Product Related	5	IMPLEMENTATION	After disbaling/stopping the External purge Service from commandline External purge Service locks are not releasing even after we stopped B2Bi,which is not good practice. User needs to manually release the locks from operations--> Lock Manager but still lock is not getting released from locks table.
Nageswararao Asi	VOTED Sterling Integrator Database Timezone to be added in dump_info output	2018-06-13T00:00:00.000Z	rfe	Product Related	5	IMPLEMENTATION	As of now when we execute dump_info.sh/cmd  it will retrieve application java version,jce version, OS version and also DbConfig information.DbConfig will have DB server parameters like cpu_count,remote_listener,local_listener.  I would like to have one more parameter to be added in dump_info like Database Timezone as well, the reason for asking this parameter is whenever there is change of DST(Daylight Saving Time) our SI application level like SFG activity shows the data which is not current because example DB is in BST and application is on GMT. It would be good for our analysis if we add this parameter.

Akhila B. Desai	Map should throw Extended rule or Compilation error when accessing wrong XML fields	2018-06-01T00:00:00.000Z	rfe	Product Related	5	MAP CHANGE/PER	In the XML maps, while writing the extended rule or logic there is possibility that we use wrong Parent tags in accessing the child Tags.  In such cases, Sterling Map editors are not throwing errors neither in Extended rules nor in the Compilation. Instead, the Map will crash while compiling. Finding out the reason for this map crash without any error is time consuming and it takes lot of effort as XML layouts are huge. Along with finding reason, we must redo all the map. So, its need that Mapper should throw extended rule error as it does in case of any flat/EDI structures.
